# Favourite, don’t like extension

Likes are dumb, favourites are awesome. Horribly built Chrome and Safari extension to replace Twitter’s new heart with its old star. It works, kind of, last time I checked.

## Installation

### Chrome
- Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
- Turn on `Developer mode` (checkbox in the top right)
- `Load unpacked extension` (the button on the left which appeared)
- Find the extension folder, `Chrome-Favourite-dont-like` in this repository and open it
- Load [Twitter](http://twitter.com)
- ...
- Profit and favourite

### Safari
- Go to `Develop` > `Show Extension Builder` in the menu
- Click the plus button > `Add Extension...` in the bottom left of the window which just appeared
- Find the extension folder, `Safari-Favourite-dont-like.safariextension` in this repository and open it
- Click the `Install` button in the top right, then `Install` in the modal
- Enter your password and click `OK`
- Load [Twitter](http://twitter.com)
- ...
- Profit and favourite

Please note the extension doesn’t contain a Safari Extension Certificate (because I don’t want a $99 Apple Developer Program Enrollment), so it will only be available until you quit Safari. Then you have go about the process from the fourth step. Which I understand you probably don’t want to do. But uh, kijk maar even.
